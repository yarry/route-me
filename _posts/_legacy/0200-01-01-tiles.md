## Why maps are tiled

The basic building block of visual maps are map tiles. Because of potentially enormous scrolling spaces supporting in higher zoom levels, map tiling libraries are generally required. 

For example, full world coverage of zoom level 10, which still isn't zoomed in enough to treat small cities as anything more than a dot, requires over a thousand 256-pixel square images per side, for a total of over one million image files and over 260,000 pixels per edge. 

Tiling libraries are needed in order to load only the tiles currently needed, as well as efficiently dispose of out-of-view tiles at optimum times. 

 * [MapBox iOS SDK]({{site.baseurl}}/mobile) - native iOS library for custom tile map views
 * [TileMill]({{site.baseurl}}/tilemill) - easily make your own map tiles on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux

## MBTiles

Formats like MBTiles let you easily transfer and bundle large tile sets with your app, as well as allow for easy offline use. And whether you go for [native app support or web technologies]({{site.baseurl}}/mobile/docs/platforms), the tools and [sample code]({{site.baseurl}}/mobile/docs/examples) are there to work with MBTiles. 

You may want to make your own tiles or use many of the freely available sets on [MapBox Hosting](http://tiles.mapbox.com/). 

 * [MBTiles specification](http://mbtiles.org) - open file format for easily storing map tiles
 * [MapBox Hosting](http://tiles.mapbox.com/) - host and share your own tiles, plus use freely-available sets
 * [MBTilesDroidSpitter](https://github.com/djcoin/MBTilesDroidSpitter) & [example app](https://github.com/djcoin/MBTilesDroidSpitterExampleSimple) - library for MBTiles support on Android
