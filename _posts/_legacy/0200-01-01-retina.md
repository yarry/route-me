[MapBox Streets](/maps) has retina tile support that can be utilized by the [iOS SDK](/mobile). This brings high-DPI display support for devices like the iPhone 4/4S and the new iPad.

Retina tiles use an enhaced look including wider streets and enlarged labels. The resulting image on retina-capable devices is incredibly sharp. Here's a side-by-side comparison up close:

## Using retina tiles with the iOS SDK

1. Create a [custom styled map](/creating/custom-styles) with the retina `2x` option enabled and save your changes.
2. In the Objective-C code, use the newly saved style's TileJSON URL and be sure to set the map view's `adjustTilesForRetinaDisplay` property to `NO`. Tiles will then draw at the normal 256-pixel size.
3. If you are supporting non-retina devices, you will want two versions of your maps, just as you have two versions of graphical assets, and detect which map to use via `[[UIScreen mainScreen] scale]`.
