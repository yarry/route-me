Will you support smartphones? Tablets? Both? 

## Viewport size

Consider the differences between smartphones (handheld use) and tablets (more traditional use). Even within one type of device, for example, Android smartphones, there are a range of screen sizes to think about. 

There are also performance considerations to think about when it comes to loading [map tiles]({{site.baseurl}}/mobile/docs/tiles). More tiles, and thus more network download operations and bandwidth, may be required for tablet devices in order to build a fullscreen map.

## Gestural differences

Think about whether your users will be using your app on the go, maybe one-handed, moving the map with their thumb, or while seated in a cafe or at a desk, using maps on a tablet device with one or both whole hands. 

Perhaps they will be working in a multitouch environment, allowing more advanced gestural manipulation such as rotating the map. Think about whether [data overlays]({{site.baseurl}}/mobile/docs/data) will affect the touch surface, as well as how those overlays should adapt to a change in zoom level. Should they stay the same size? Zoom with the map? Cluster together as one point to better represent data density? 

## Gathering information

Consider using a service like [TestFlight](http://testflightapp.com/) or [HockeyApp](http://www.hockeyapp.net/) to enroll beta testers and get builds to them in a short amount of time, as well as **maintain metrics** on how thoroughly they are testing your app.
